This a python program I made to spam messages from inside a text chat

if the chat you want to send messages too does not use 'Enter' as a shortcut to send messages you will probably have to alter the code

# Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:
   
python3-pyautogui
python3-time
python3-termcolor

4. Run: python3 text_spammer.py

It works mainly using PyAutoGUI
Instructions in program are mostly straightfoward basically have the text conversation you want to spam loaded up then run program and navigate back to the conversation

*** This isnt a super sophisticated 'spammer' but it does the job
