This a python program I made to spam messages from inside a text chat

*** if that chat you want to send messages too does not use 'Enter' as a shortcut to send messages you will probably have to alter the code

It works mainly using PyAutoGUI
Instructions in program are mostly straightfoward basically have the text conversation you want to spam loaded up then run program and navigate back to the conversation

*** This isnt a super sophisticated 'spammer' but it does the job
